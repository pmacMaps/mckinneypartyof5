As I put words onto paper. I am again at a loss for what to focus my thoughts on. Power, death, friendships, poetry, love.
<br />
<br />

Life is happening and I feel a twinge of pain and regret that I cannot keep up with it all.
<br />
<br />
I cannot find enough strength to have a conversation or deal with my crying children.
<br />
<br />
Breathe.  
<br />
<br />
And rest. Because resting is good. Take a break.
<br />
<br />
There is no need to feel that if I am not engaging with someone, I am useless.
<br />
<br />
I am enough just as I am.
<br />
